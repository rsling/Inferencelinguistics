\section*{Inference, Not Statistics}

\section*{Methods and the Progression of Topics}

Readers should be aware that Chapter~\ref{sec:fisher} progresses very slowly, is very repetitive, and contains a lot of detail and material for illustrative purposes.
This changes in later chapters, and we speed up the narrative significantly.
However, a slow start is clearly desirable given what we said in Section~\ref{sec:need}.
