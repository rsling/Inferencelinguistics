\section{The Need for A New Introduction to Statistics}\label{sec:need}

\section{Methods and the Progression of Topics}

Readers should be aware that Chapter~\ref{sec:fisher} progresses very slowly, is very repetitive, and contains a lot of detail and material for illustrative purposes.
This changes in later chapters, and we speed up the narrative significantly.
However, a slow start is clearly desirable given what we said in Section~\ref{sec:need}.

Notice that we intentionally use sections where there is not much new and difficult content per se (such as Section~\ref{sec:nominal}) to introduce mathematical concepts and notation.
This is especially the case in the first three or four chapters.
